# Semantic elements structure

1. Mark up a letter that will be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response regarding the application to
   the university.

Get the [raw text](letter/content.txt) you need to mark up.

Notes:

- use appropriate document structure
- in general, the letter should be marked up as an organization of headings and paragraphs
- dates should also have appropriate machine-readable values
- acronyms/abbreviations need to be marked up correctly
- parts of chemical formulae have to be subscripted/supscripted correctly
- for the hyperlinks, use the ``http://example.com`` as the URL
- mark up the university moto with appropriate elements
- create a stylesheet file and add a class which will align the content to the right
- use HTML validator to validate the solution
