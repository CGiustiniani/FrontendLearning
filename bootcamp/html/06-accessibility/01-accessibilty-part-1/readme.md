# Accessibility: Intro

> The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

Accessibility (often abbreviated as A11y - as in "a", then 11 characters, then "y") in web development means enabling as
many people as possible to use web sites we produce.

Web is being used more and more either for personal or business reasons. With that, everyone should be able to use it.
Around 80 million people in EU have some kind of a disability. That is huge pool of users that should be able to use
your web pages as anyone else.

You might also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities. Same as it is
wrong to exclude somebody from a physical building if they are in wheelchair, it is also not right to exclude someone
from a website because they have a visual impairment.

More and more countries are demanding web pages to be accessible. There are some cases where people would sue the page
because it was not accessible (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html">Blind man sued
Domino's</a>). Therefore, we can understand that provision of accessible sites is part of the low in some countries.

Building accessible web sites benefits everyone:

- semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO
- caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and moral, which improves your public image
- good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users

## Disabilities

There are different disabilities that people have, which require additional focus when building an accessible web. Some
of them are:

- people with visual impairments - they include people with blindness, low-level vision and color blindness. Many people
  use screen magnifiers (either physical or software zoom), while some users will rely on screen readers, which are
  tackled in the next chapter.
- people with hearing impairments - we should always provide textual alternatives for audio/video content,
- people with mobility impairments - they have disabilities concerning movement. Some people might have difficulty
  making the exact hand movements required to use a mouse, while others might be more severely affected, and use a head
  pointer to interact with computers. Additionally, this kind of disability can also be a result of age. Here we have to
  cover the "keyboardability" and the possibility for users to navigate our page with keyboard only.
- people with cognitive impairments - here we refer to a broad range of disabilities, from people with intellectual
  disabilities to all of us, as we age and have difficulty thinking and remembering. It also includes people with
  learning disabilities, such as dyslexia. For such disabilities, we can focus on following to help them in website
  usage:
    - delivering content in more than one way
    - easily understood content
    - focusing attention on important content
    - minimizing distractions, such as unnecessary content or ads
    - consistent webpage layout and navigation
    - familiar elements, such as underlined links blue when not visited, and purple when visited
    - dividing processes into logical, essential steps with progress indicators
    - making forms easy to complete, with clear error messages and simple error recovery

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

W3C published a large and very detailed document that includes very precise, technology-agnostic criteria for
accessibility conformance. See a light introduction
at [WCAG at a glance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/).

There are three levels which tells how much the page is accessible:

- Level A - Essential - Without it the majority of disabled users cannot make use of the website.
- Level AA - Recommended - Achievable with reasonably effort. Required by law in some European countries for
  governmental institutions and companies.
- Level AAA - Maximum - Maximum support for disabled users but can limit experience for all users (e.g. limited
  presentation, no complex content). Very high effort needed (also to content editors).
