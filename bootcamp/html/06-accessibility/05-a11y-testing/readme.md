# Accessibility testing

When it comes to testing the efforts we did to make our website accessible, there are different tools and options.

In this area, we'll just go over three examples, but there are many more. See the full list of accessibility evaluation
tools on [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/).

## A11y Project

[A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier. This
website contains various groups of different content, software, books, blog posts, online tools and many more, which can
help us in making the efforts smaller when conducting a11y implementation.

Besides these, it also has a checklist, which is based on the WCAG, and provides a easy-to-use steps of what we need to
do in order to fulfill certain accessibility criteria. Worth mentioning, the A11Y Project strives for AA level of
compliance.

Following the checklist, however, does not guarantee the website to be accessible, because there might be specific
requirements for the website/functionality which are perhaps not there in the checklist. In general, there is no such
thing as "perfect a11y", or being "100% accessible".

[Find the checklist here](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/).

## aXe

aXe is an accessibility Engine for automated testing of HTML-based user interfaces. It can check the HTML and find
potential a11y problems and report them.

For example, there are browser extensions that can be used in developer tools to evaluate the page you're browsing.

[aXe chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
.

On the following image, you can see how the Lighthouse extension can look like:

For exercise, examine one website with aXe chrome extension.

## Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the performance, quality and correctness of your web apps.
Besides a11y, Lighthouse can check multiple different categories, e.g. _performance_, _SEO_ or _best practices_.

Our focus will be on _Accessibility_.

On the following image, you can see how the Lighthouse extension can look like:
![lighthouse example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CGiustiniani/FrontendLearning/main/bootcamp/html/06-accessibility/05-a11y-testing/lighthouse.png)

Report can be generated by clicking the _Generate report_ button.

For exercise, examine one website with Lighthouse chrome extension.
