# Asynchronous JavaScript

## Synchronous JavaScript

Normally, a given program's code runs straight along, with only one thing happening at once. If a function relies on the result of another function, it has to wait for the other function to finish and return, and until that happens, the entire program is essentially stopped from the perspective of the user.

When a web app runs in a browser and it executes an intensive chunk of code without returning control to the browser, the browser can appear to be frozen. This is called blocking; the browser is blocked from continuing to handle user input and perform other tasks until the web app returns control of the processor.


## Asynchronous JavaScript

Many Web API features now use asynchronous code to run, especially those that access or fetch some kind of resource from an external device, such as fetching a file from the network, accessing a database and returning data from it, accessing a video stream from a web cam, or broadcasting the display to a VR headset.

Example:

```js
let response = fetch('myImage.png'); // fetch is asynchronous
let blob = response.blob();
// display your image blob in the UI somehow
```
There are two main types of asynchronous code style you'll come across in JavaScript code, old-style callbacks and newer promise-style code. In the below sections we'll review each of these in turn.

### Async callbacks

Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when calling a function which will start executing code in the background. When the background code finishes running, it calls the callback function to let you know the work is done, or to let you know that something of interest has happened. Using callbacks is slightly old-fashioned now, but you'll still see them in use in a number of older-but-still-commonly-used APIs.

An example of an async callback is the second parameter of the `addEventListener()` method.

Another example that loads a resource via the XMLHttpRequest API:
```js
function loadAsset(url, type, callback) {
  let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', url);
  xhr.responseType = type;

  xhr.onload = function() {
    callback(xhr.response);
  };

  xhr.send();
}

function displayImage(blob) {
  let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

  let image = document.createElement('img');
  image.src = objectURL;
  document.body.appendChild(image);
}

loadAsset('https://www.bmc-switzerland.com/media/catalog/category/BMC_Parent_Category_Header_Image_Mountain_All_Mountain_1.jpg', 'blob', displayImage);
```

### Promise

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A `Promise` is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason.

A `Promise` is in one of these states:
- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

Example:
```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('foo');
  }, 300);
});

myPromise
.then(value => { return value + ' and bar'; })
.then(value => { return value + ' and bar again'; })
.then(value => { return value + ' and again'; })
.then(value => { return value + ' and again'; })
.then(value => { console.log(value) })
.catch(err => { console.log(err) })
.finally(value => {console.log('finally')});
```

*** Promise.all() ***

The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises. This returned promise will resolve when all of the input's promises have resolved, or if the input iterable contains no promises. It rejects immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting or non-promises throwing an error, and will reject with this first rejection message / error.

```js
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((values) => {
  console.log(values);
});
// expected output: Array [3, 42, "foo"]
```

### Fetch API

`fetch()` API is basically like a modern, more efficient version of XMLHttpRequest.

The fetch() method of the WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope mixin starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available. The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request. The promise does not reject on HTTP errors â€” it only rejects on network errors. You must use then handlers to check for HTTP errors.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
.then(function(response) {
  return response.json();
}).then(function(json) {
  let posts = json;
  console.log(posts);
}).catch(function(err) {
  console.log('Fetch problem: ' + err.message);
});
```
