# Todo app


**As a** website editor \
**I want to** create my list of tasks \
**so that** I dont forget what I have to do

**Acceptance Criteria**

There is a label with text: Todo <br/>
Below the label is the input field <br/>
Below the input field is the Submit button <br/>

When a user submits his todo it should be added below the button.
- if the input field is empty and submit button clicked show alert message "Input field can't be empty"

Each todo item has a red X on the right side and bottom line.
- when the user clicks the X button show confirm dialog with text "Are you sure?"
- if confirmed delete the item from the list, otherwise do nothing 

Please see attached design example, feel free to design it as you want.
