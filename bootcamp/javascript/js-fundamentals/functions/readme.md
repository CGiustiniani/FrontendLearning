# Functions

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

### Why do we Write Functions?
1. They allow us to conceive of our program as a bunch of sub-steps. (Each sub-step can be its own function. When any program seems too hard, just break the overall program into sub-steps!)
2. They allow us to reuse code instead of rewriting it.
3. Functions allow us to keep our variable namespace clean (local variables only "live" as long as the function does). In other words, `function1` can use a variable called `i`, and `function2` can also use a variable called `i` and there is no confusion. Each variable `i` only exists when the computer is executing the given function.
4. Functions allow us to test small parts of our program in isolation from the rest.

## Defining functions

### Function declarations

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
