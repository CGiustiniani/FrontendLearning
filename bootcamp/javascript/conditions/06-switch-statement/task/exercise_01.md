## Exercise 1

T = Temperature
D = Day
W = Weather

If the temperature is below `22` set the blinds to a specific position as defined:
- Monday: `25%`
- Wednesday: `30%`
- Friday: `50%`
- All other days: `70%`

To set the blinds position use: `setBlindsPosition(25)` (numeric value without the `%` sign)
